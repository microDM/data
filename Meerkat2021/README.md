## Diurnal Oscillations in Gut Bacterial Load and Composition

This dataset, titled **"Diurnal oscillations in gut bacterial load and composition eclipse seasonal and lifetime dynamics in wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta,"** contains data and code associated with a study published in *Nature Communications* (2021). The research investigates the dynamics of gut microbiomes in wild meerkats, focusing on the significant diurnal variations that surpass seasonal and lifetime changes.

## Data Origin

The core of this dataset is the `processed_data_phyloseq.RDS` object, which is a phyloseq object containing processed data for 1109 samples. This object includes:

- **ASV table**: Amplicon Sequence Variants quantified across samples.
- **taxonomic classifications**: Taxonomy assigned to each ASV.
- **phylogenetic tree**: A tree structure representing the evolutionary relationships among ASVs.
- **sample metadata**: Relevant metadata for each sample used in the analysis.

To facilitate further analysis and integration, the `processed_data_phyloseq.RDS` object has been converted into a `TreeSummarizedExperiment` object; `Meerkat2021.rds` using [mia](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/) tools.
